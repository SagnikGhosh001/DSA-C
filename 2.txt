Overflow and underflow are terms commonly used in the context of computer science, specifically in relation to numerical representations, such as integers or floating-point numbers.

Overflow:

Definition: Overflow occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for a data type. In other words, the result is too large to be stored within the allocated memory space.
Example: If you have a variable that can only store values from -128 to 127 (a signed 8-bit integer), attempting to add 1 to 127 would cause an overflow, resulting in a value of -128.
Underflow:

Definition: Underflow is the opposite of overflow. It happens when the result of an arithmetic operation is smaller than the minimum representable value for a data type. The result is too small to be accurately represented within the available memory.
Example: Consider a scenario where you have a variable representing positive numbers in the range of 0 to 1 (using a floating-point representation). If you subtract a very small number from 0, the result might be too small to be accurately represented, leading to underflow.
Overflow and underflow can have significant consequences in computer programs, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors, loss of precision, or even crashes. Developers need to be mindful of the data types they use and implement appropriate checks to handle potential overflow or underflow situations in their code.
